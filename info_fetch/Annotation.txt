Annotation for each function in the file "utilities.py"

def fetch(url)
This function extracts the info from the input url page and all "next" pages by using the BeautifulSoup/requests package in python.
It first fetches all content in the web page with input url, then extras paper title and name of author(s) by pure string manipulations.
It works with "findnext" function to fetch next page(s) (if any).
It will return a dict structure. Key is paper title, Value is list of name of author(s)

def findnext(start)
This function takes an input url "start" and return url to the next page (if any)
It first fetches "navbar" element in the webpage and searches whether there is a url for "next page".
If there is an url of "next page", it would return True and url. Otherwise, it would return False and None.

def search(name):
This function takes the name to be searched and returns the corresponding url in MathSciNet.
It only involves string manipulation.

def fetch_list():
This function reads a local text file in which the name list is stored. It uses all three functions above and outputs a dict structure. Key is the author's name. Value is another dict which is the output of a fetch function. It would store this variable locally for further use.
Notice: Local store means to save the usage of web fetch function

def find_joint():
It reads the output info of fetch_list and outputs the number of joint publications between any pair of authors. It involves for loop for iteration.
