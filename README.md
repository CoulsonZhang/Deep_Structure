https://ymb.web.illinois.edu/teaching/igl-projects-s22/

To Do:
- reference fetch function compatibility
> - trouble: differnt pages have various format in pure string type
> - Current solution: only get those paper that is collected in MathSciNet
- entry integration (all function, class structure may be utilized)
- Structure optimization. 3 dict may be redundant 
- Auto name correction (search) by MathSciNet engine

Finished:
- search result page info fetch (paper title, authors' name)
- "next" page url fetch 
- Paper detailed intro page url fetch 
- Paper reference page url fetch
- Joint publication number between any pair of authors
